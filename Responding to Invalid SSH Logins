In this lesson, we'll explore a real-world scenario in which an EC2 instance is experiencing multiple failed SSH logins, and we want to automatically take the instance offline in response to this potential security event.

Use the Web Server Log Group and the Invalid SSH Login metric filter to trigger a CloudWatch alarm set for 2 data points within 1 minute.

This alarm should publish to an alarm notification SNS topic and send you an email as well as trigger the Lambda function to stop the instance.

Configure the EC2 Instance

The EC2 instance must have an IAM role that can communicate with both CloudWatch and Systems Manager.

Create an IAM Instance Role

Select IAM > Create Role > AWS Service > EC2 > Next: Permissions.

Select the CloudWatchAgentAdminPolicy managed policy.

Select the AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore managed policy.

Name the role "CloudWatchAgentAdminRole".

Launch the EC2 Instance

Select Amazon Linux 2.

Create or select a security group with SSH (port 22) open to the public (0.0.0.0/0).

Attach the IAM Role to the Instance

Assign the CloudWatchAgentAdminRole IAM role to the EC2 instance.

Install CloudWatch Agent using Systems Manager

Run command: AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage

Action: Install

Name: AmazonCloudWatchAgent

Configure the CloudWatch Agent

Run the CloudWatch Agent Configuration Wizard.

Create a new session using SSM Session Manager.

 sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard
 
Note: Do not select CollectD, unless you already installed it using sudo yum install collectd.

Specify /var/log/secure at the "Do you want to monitor any log files?" prompt.

Validate the Configuration
```sh
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -c file:/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json -s
```
Create an SNS Topic

The CloudWatch Alarm will notify this topic, and the topic will trigger the Lambda function.

Topic name: AlarmNotificationTopic

Configure the CloudWatch Alarm

Add a Metric Filter to the Web Server Log Group

Click Secure log group.

Click Create metric filter.

Filter pattern: [Mon, day, timestamp, ip, id, status = Invalid*]

Click Test pattern.

Click Assign metric.

Filter name: InvalidSSHLogin

Metric namespace: SSH

Metric name: InvalidSSHLogin

Click Create filter.

Create Alarm

Metric filter: SSH/InvalidSSHLogin

Click Create alarm.

Name: InvalidSSHLoginAlarm

Description: Invalid login attempts >2 in 1 min for instance <append instance ID>

Note: The description is critical, as the instance ID at the end is used by the Lambda function to stop the instance.

Whenever InvalidSSHLogin >= 2 for 1 out of 1 datapoints

Subscribe to the SNS Topic

Select AlarmNotificationTopic and click Create alarm.

Create IAM Role for Lambda Function

Create the role LambdaStopInstances using policy lambda_execution_role.json.

Create Lambda function

Name: StopInstance

Role: StopInstancesRole

Trigger Lambda from SNS

Select Trigger > SNS > AlarmNotificationTopic.

Trigger the CloudWatch Alarm

Make 3 invalid SSH login attempts within 2 minutes.

Verify that the secure log contains the Invalid user string.

Verify that the CloudWatch alarm is set.

Verify that the CloudWatch Log for the Lambda function ran.

Verify that the EC2 instance is stopped.
