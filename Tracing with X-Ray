In this video, we're going to learn about tracing our application with AWS X-Ray.

We are going to deploy a sample Flask application that is instrumented with the X-Ray SDK, make some sample requests, and then examine the traces and service maps in the AWS Management Console.

Zappa GitHub Repo: https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa

Create a DynamoDB Table

Create a table called Flask with a primary partition key called key.

 aws dynamodb create-table --table-name Flask \
   --attribute-definitions AttributeName=key,AttributeType=S \
   --key-schema AttributeName=key,KeyType=HASH \
   --billing-mode=PAY_PER_REQUEST
   
Configure Zappa

Run the following command:

 cd example
 pipenv --python 3.7
 pipenv shell
 pipenv install aws-xray-sdk flask zappa requests
 pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt
 
 zappa init
 
Add the following property to zappa_settings.json:

 "xray_tracing": true
Deploy the application.

 zappa deploy
 
Enable X-Ray Tracing for API Gateway
In this step, we will interact with the API Gateway Console to enable X-Ray tracing.

Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the API Gateway Console at https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/apigateway/.

Select your API (e.g., example-dev).

Select Stages.

Choose the name of your deployment stage (e.g., dev).

On the Logs/Tracing tab, select the Enable X-Ray Tracing box.

Click Save Changes.

Navigate to the endpoint in your browser.
