In this lesson, we'll create a Lambda function that revokes user access keys periodically to enforce rotation and mitigate risk.

The Lambda function will perform the following:

Collect IAM users using pagination

Scan each user for existing IAM access keys older than 90 days

Deactivate the keys

Send email alerts to the administrator

Scheduled CloudWatch Rule:

Triggers the Lambda function to run (e.g., weekly)

Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES)

Be sure to use an SES-verified email address to ensure proper delivery of emails.

SES API endpoints are not available in all regions. Go here for a list of supported endpoints.
