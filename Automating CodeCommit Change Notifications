In this lesson, we'll demonstrate how to receive detailed email notifications about file changes and commit messages when a code update is pushed to CodeCommit. A code reviewer may subscribe to the SNS topic and recieve updates for any changes.

Create the CodeCommit Repository

aws codecommit create-repository --repository-name ChangeNotification

Note the cloneUrlHttp and Arn values in the response.

Create and Subscribe to the SNS Topic

aws sns create-topic --name CodeCommitChangeNotification

aws sns subscribe \
--topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:CodeCommitChangeNotification \
--protocol email \
--notification-endpoint my-email@example.com

Create an IAM Lambda Execution Role

Add AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole.

Add the following policy: LambdaCodeCommitSnsPolicy.

 {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [{
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
         "codecommit:*",
         "sns:*"
         ],
         "Resource": "*"
     }]
 }
 
Create the Lambda Function

Name it "CodeCommitChangeNotification".

Set the following environment variables:

REPOSITORY_NAME = ChangeNotification

SNS_TOPIC_ARN = arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:CodeCommitChangeNotification

Create the CloudWatch Event Rule

This rule will detect branch or repository changes.

Choose Event Pattern.

Service Name: CodeCommit

Event Type: CodeCommit Repository State Change

Select Specific resource(s) by ARN, and enter the CodeCommit Repository ARN.

Select the referenceCreated and referenceUpdated events.

Event Pattern:

 {
 "source": [
     "aws.codecommit"
 ],
 "detail-type": [
     "CodeCommit Repository State Change"
 ],
 "resources": [
     "arn:aws:codecommit:us-east-1:123456789012:ChangeNotification"
 ]
 }
 
Under Target, select the CodeCommitChangeNotification function.

Commit a Change

Create and commit a file.

Edit the file and commit it.
